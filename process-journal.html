                <p>This process journal records my progress as a designer throughout the semester; in particular stages of critical thinking and places where I was challenged to think outside the box. The topics presented to us to carefully consider were autonomous technology & systems. In a world where the integration of technology is currently essential, advancement is inevitable with many autonomous technologies already in use today. Personally, this was the first time I was confronted with the task of having to think about autonomous technologies from a developer’s perspective.  My group members were sharing the same experience, so we were able to begin our research from a similar point of view.</p>

                <p>Our group’s aim was to create an application that could help people, making an unfamiliar technology approachable for regular users. We decided to research medical fields as nothing in life is important as a person’s health. Our goal ultimately was to tailor medical services accurately and promptly to those who require emergency ambulance services using an autonomous system/technology.

              <div class="col-md-7">
                <p>As a group before we decided on a goal, it took us a long time to decide on a topic. We found ourselves continuously coming back to autonomous vehicles as a solution due to it being the technology we knew most about. Uncertain of deciding on a topic we were unconfident with, our group attempted to create specific solutions before researching. This led us into an infinite loop of brainstorming as we had no information or research to check that the answers we produced were valid solutions.</p>

              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p> Seeing our group struggle with arriving to a decision in numerous studio sessions, our tutor advised us to think big. She reminded us that instead of trying to come up with an immediate solution, the purpose of the research was to use the information to find a direction. Through this experience I learnt that to be a designer, it was essential to be more open minded. Despite having been taught this in previous subjects, this was the first time I had found myself this frustrated in the ideation process. By personally experiencing the necessity of keeping an open mind  it left a memorable impact, something that will now keep in mind. </p>
              </div>

                <p>Soon after, the broader approach of ‘streamlining emergency ambulance services’ was adopted with each group member being tasked with researching a different aspect that affected ambulance services. Annie researched regular users, Evelyn researched caretakers and I researched professional medical staff. The reason for dividing the research into three different directions was to see if there were any common issues between these three groups. By identifying common issues we would be able to create an effective solution to cover all groups instead of focusing solely on one. This is especially important in ambulance services that rely on not only the medical professionals but also the users for a smooth operation. </p>

                <p>To gain some background information on the field we chose, I researched existing autonomous technology that existed for medicine. The two that I looked at closely were drone delivery systems, both located in third world countries. Through the usage of autonomous technology, time critical situations can be dealt with as efficiently as possible, as well as preserving human resources that are needed elsewhere. This research step showed what was currently possible with autonomous situations and the method of assistance given to people in need, directing me to clearer ideas on how these situations correlated with our goal. </p>

                <p>Whilst creating a research plan to better organise myself, I drafted four questions to answer. These questions would help me target what I needed to find out from the medical professionals without asking unnecessary questions as well as make the most of my time limit of two weeks for research. 
                  <ul>
                    <li>How are ambulances used today?</li>
                    <li>How do people interact with ambulances?</li>
                    <li>How do the needs and usages shift depending on the user’s perspective (patient vs medical professional?)</li>
                    <li>How can the ambulance service be improved?</li>
                  </ul> 
                </p>

              <p> My core users are medical professionals who work with or directly interact with ambulances. By interviewing the core users (medical professionals) who have the most knowledge over how the system works, I gained a clear idea of their needs and wants.</p>

                <p>By interviewing the core users (medical professionals) who have the most knowledge over how the system functions, we can understand their needs. Through examining the interviews, it will be easier to identify priorities and problems are faced as well as if they would find the data valuable. As interviews are a more intimate method of gathering data, I was able to have a more personal understanding of their needs. Reaching out to people in their professional setting was nerve-wrecking but a good experience I learnt from, especially as I usually have difficulty talking to people. By being able to have conversationswith these people, it gave me confidence to know that I could interview professionals again in the future.  </p>

                <p>Organising the data lead to three main issues that were shared by some of the interviewees:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Resources (equipment)</li>
                    <li>Manpower (staff)</li>

                <h5>Surveys</h5>
                 <p>As five people were a rather small sample size, I decided the best next step would be to get more opinions and insights from other people within the industry. Due to time constraints, it was impossible to actively and effectively locate more core users for interviews. To reach a broader number of people who qualified, I created an online survey with the issues found.</p>

                 <p>All participants were part of the user group and were found by contacting previous interviewees with a request to pass it to any willing coworkers. Other participants were gathered online through forums. The questions focused on concerns and the user experiences currently experienced by participants to help identify further the required needs.</p>

                  <p>In total there were <b>47 responses</b> to the survey with two main sections of questions.</p>

                  <p>When observing answers for key concerns regarding the ambulance service the two main issues are resource and time sensitive. Previous research on existing technology confirmed these responses as being prevalent in daily medical scenarios; not being limited to solely extreme cases.</p>

                 <p>With the large amount of information I gathered from research, it was difficult to organise it in a coherent manner by simply reading interview transcripts or survey data. By using an affinity diagram, I combined results from both the interviews and the survey.  Through analysis the data was deciphered into what the core user’s needs were:</p>

                 <p><ul>
                    <li>I want to <b>communicate</b> better with patients.</li>

                 <p>Two personas were created to represent the core users and to confront the issues that were identified with the affinity diagram. I created a storyboard to depict the current experience of one of the personas, showing the struggles they face daily. Personas helped me understand their needs, experiences, behaviours and goals by making me look at the situation from their perspectives. By understanding their needs it gave me a clearer target as a designer, creating a better guide to design their ideal user experience.   </p>

                <h5>The Next Step</h5>
                 <p>Conducting a research report made it clear that there is definitely potential within the current system for emergency ambulance services to be streamlined. To do this, we would need to look further at communication issues, better distribution of equipment/staff as well as creating some kind of system that educated its users. By solving these issues, staff would have more time to focus on patients and take better care of both their physical and mental states.  </p>

                 <p>As the first individual research report with a large workload, it was a very daunting challenge especially considering the small time frame given to finish everything. However, once I sat down and set the research into steps it turned into a managable workflow, making it easier to process what I had done and what information I now required; influencing my next steps. This helped me to grow as a designer by working on research and its organisation individually so I was forced to oversee all points of action and take full responsibility for the report.</p>

For the solution to be effective it had to address and counter both these issues, with a bigger focus on less urgent medical situations. This will allow better allocation of resources for more urgent emergencies to take priority.  </p>

                <p>Multiple brainstorming sessions were taken to break down our user needs and issues as it was important for us to better understand the problem areas and context before attempting to design any solutions. <br>

                Using the advice we had received in the research report to 'think big', we used brainstorming once more to list any and all ideas, despite how farfetched they felt. By generating multiple ideas, it exposed us to the various directions we could go as well as providing a vast pool of concepts that we could consider.</p>
              </div>
            </div>


            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>Continuing from that session, each group member chose two of their best ideas and briefly explained it, holding an iterative ideation session to build it further. Each idea was written on a page and passed along for each member to add a feature that improved the design. It was then passed around again twice to list pros and another two times to list cons from each member. These iterative rounds were conducted for each of the six potential solutions. 
                The shared ideas were: 
                  <ul>
                    <li>ambulance drones</li>
                    <li>robotic AI paramedic assistants</li>
                    <li>autonomous decision making AI recognition devices</li>
                    <li>a triaging mobile application </li>
                    <li>a smart ambulance </li>
                    <li>an autonomous equipment allocation system</li>
                  </ul></p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>This physical act of passing around the paper and ideating as a group helped make progress as we were more aware of how we approached critiqued an idea if it originated from someone else. The sheer amount of brainstorming we did in these sessions also prevented us from lingering too long on one idea as each session had time limits, giving us a better objective view after we finished said sessions. </p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>The three best ideas were chosen, deciding through votes. 
                <ul>
                    <li>the triaging mobile application </li>
                    <li> a smart ambulance </li>
                    <li>an autonomous equipment allocation system</li>
                </ul></p>

                <p>The triaging mobile application would work using the phone's camera, acting as a scanner to triage a person's body when the application is in use. It will identify injuries and inform the user of its severity; autonomously making a decision to judge if said injury requires immediate medical attention. This idea solves the issue of users being unable to make informed decisions of their injury due ignorance and potential panic that may occur when one is hurt. </p>

                <p>Smart ambulances are high-tech, numerous sensors like heart rate sensor, blood pressure, ECG judging status of vital parameters. Information on the patient is sent to the hospital's database with the smart ambulance being able to operate traffic signals to create a faster route whilst transporting patients. </p>

                <p>An autonomous equipment allocation system would depend on data of a patient's injury before the ambulance's departure. The patient's data is assessed; the system judging autonomously what specialised equipment is optimal for each specific case. This ensures paramedics will be prepared, having access to both the existing general medical equipment and any specialised equipment that may be specific to a particular patient's case. </p>

                <p>We realised after discussions and consulting with the tutor that the ideas could still be improved upon. Despite basing our ideas around our initial mind map of user needs and issues, we found the incorporation of our central theme, autonomous technologies, was still minimal. </p>
              </div>
            </div>

           <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>Therefore another round of brainstorming was conducted to explore any autonomous technology related features. Each member once again chose their ideal suggestion with these being:
                <ul>
                    <li>medical chips</li>
                    <li>automatic traffic lights </li>
                    <li>AI recognition street cameras</li>
                </ul>
                We found potential in these new ideas, especially as they could be encorporated with the previous three suggestions. Through integration with the three previously iterated ideas, we would to create an autonomous system that would benefit both regular users and emergency service staff. </p>

                <p>On reflection, we spent too much time in the ideation stage which interfered with our planned timeline. The experience however, was not completely negative as it's unrealistic for everything to go as planned. This made us realise that plans more often than not have to be flexible and we must be prepared for any issues that may occur, especially when the issue originates from us with wanting a flawless idea before starting. Through these struggles, we realised that ideas are refined best through the process of active ideating rather than continuously trying to think of complete solution from the beginning of the project.  </p>

                <h5>The Solution</h5>
                 <p>We decided to create an <b>autonomous ecosystem</b>. To interact with this system, creating three potential interface ideas, focusing on the patient's side of the problem. This was due to patients being the reason why these ambulance services are needed - thus, the main users that would dictate the flow of the system would be regular patients and callers. We concluded that if less resources were wasted on cases that did not require professional medical attention, the system would ultimately assist emergency service staff. <br>
                  As the final product aim of this research was to make an interface, our group decided on three potential devices said interface would be developed for. 
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>futuristic triaging street lamps</b> that use sensors and cameras to autonomously detect and triage certain injuries in public areas.</li>
                    <li> <b>a smartwatch application</b> that uses sensors to detect bodily injuries of wearer.</li>
                    <li><b>mobile triaging application</b> that uses AI recognition and futuristic technology to scan and triage any injuries or illnesses.</li>
                  </ul>
              Whilst continuing to build upon our ideas, we came across a major flaw in the design of the street lamp. The main reason for this idea was to cover emergencies in public areas as a safe, constant presence. However, these devices would not be able to cover private locations due to their nature. There were also ethical issues to consider such as the use of surveillance cameras for triage purposes could potentially breaching one's privacy without consent. Due to these reasons it was abandoned. </p>

               <p>Storyboards were created to provide a visual understanding and  explanation of our solution interfaces with user scenarios and respective storyboards drawn up. By having these in visual form, it made the flow personally easier to interpret rather than trying to explain everything in text. As a visual learner, I found that I understood things much easier when I sketched them out in comparison to trying convey my words through structured reports. As a designer, knowing which tools are my strongest assets will assist me greatly in the future as I can successfully determine what I am the most confident and comfortable with. </p>

                <p>The main user evaluation method used was the <b>think aloud protocol</b> so that we would be able to observe their thoughts whilst users interacted with the interfaces, giving designers live direct feedback. Users were asked to complete tasks as they were oberved whilst being timed, errors and comments being recorded with design heuristics being evaluated through interactions with the interface. </p>

                <p>When doing user tests, I made certain that each iteration had at least one completely new user as well as one medical professional testing the interface for accurate and relevant feedback. The first two iterations were low-fidelity on paper, with only the last being high-fidelity and being tested through the InVision website.</p>

                <h5>First Iteration</h5>
                <p>As the first iteration, we created two potential interfaces for users to interact with. The purpose of this was to see which would be recieved better by users as being a more user-friendly interface.</p> 

                <p>The mobile application involved the user manually triaging their injury to be able to identify the severity of the injury and make a decision regarding if they wished to call an ambulance or not. By allowing the device to autonomously make the decision for the user regarding if they required an ambulance, it automatically removes the need for unnecessary calls. As the profile data logs the user's personal information, we locked it behind biometrics and a pin. The importance of importance of being able to distinguish between being logged out of the user's account when triaging others tried to be pointed out through tasks as by being triaged under somebody else's profile could have negative effects (e.g wrong blood type for blood transfusions).</p>

                <p>I user-tested with three people in the first iteration, Andrea, Jacke and Beatris. Andrea being one of the people I interviewed for the research report had context on what she was testing, giving great real world advice. She critiqued the design in regards to its use of medical terminology, wanting more accuracy as well as the data written down on the paper prototype as it is vital in the field of medicine to be precise. Beatris and Jake whilst being 'normal users' had experience calling ambulances in the past. Jake found both interfaces fine whilst Beatris having studied user interface related subjects at her universities had a lot of criticisms, comments and questions regarding the UI and our thought processes leading up to said decisions. </p>

                <p>When user testing, we ran into a lot of issues that weren't even considered when designing. There was a demand for a home screen to enable user freedom control, allowing users to freely 'exit' when needed. The main camera screen when presented was met with confusion from certain users as they were not sure how to operate it. Design elements were also put under question as there was a mismatch between the system and real world designs, especially in terms of icons </p>

                <p>The smartwatch application involved triaging passively using the body's vital signs, requiring no active input from the user. Many users when testing the paper prototype found that the amount of text and information was too overwhelming for the smaller screen estate size of a smartwatch. Navigating a smartwatch was also something majority of testing participants were not experienced with, resulting in numerous navigational issues as they were not sure if to swipe or press a button. </p>

                <p>A survey was conducted to assess users' experience with the two interfaces. By totalling the scale based responses and converting it into percentages, results showed that users found the smartwatch easier to navigate than the phone application; even when considering this paper prototype being their first interaction with a 'smartwatch'. </p>

                <p>When conducting these user tests, I was taken aback by how differently each individual interacted with the interface. Some users were able to accomplish tasks without any difficulties whilst others needed help to finish them, taking much longer time wise in comparison. I was also not expecting so many questions and comments from users when testing, with Andrea and Beatris being more personally invested in giving feedback as it related to their personal interests whilst Jake approached the interface with a less critical mind. </p>

                <h5>Second Iteration</h5>
                <p>When creating the second iteration, the feedback from the user evaluation sessions were carefully considered. The designs for both interfaces were adjusted, adding in numerous suggested features like a homescreen to address voiced heuristic concerns. Major adjustments were made to the navigational aspect of the application, making it easier to access pages and return to major screens. Other prevalanet issues such as icon designs and documentation were also fixed, creating a better match between system and the real world. </p> 

                <p>I tested five users in total, two users (Jacke & Beatris) from the previous iteration being asked to partake in testing once more to make a comparison. Both users approved of the login page and navigational footer added to the mobile, expressing their preference of the new homepage for the smartwatch being clearer with less text. Stephanie (medical scribe) was able to participate in user testing this round, having similar context to Andrea as she was another person I interviewed for the research report. Stephanie was enthusiastic about the project, having great personal interest in health related applications due to a relevant field she had studied briefly at her school. Due to said personal interest, she contributed greatly by writing extensive replies in the user survey from the perspective of someone with medical training. Denise and Melissa are two regular users who had never interacted with the interface previously and as a result had some difficulty understanding the interface's purpose. However, overall both were able to accomplish all tasks and agreed that the aplication made them feel more confident in the emergency ambulance service.</p> 

                <p>Once all user tests were done, we compiled the results as a group once more to identify common issues users had. Despite changing the icons in this iteration, such as an 'i' representing first aid tips being changed to a first aid cross, not all users could understand what the icon was supposed to represent. There were also requests for better help and documentation on both devices, with users expressing their frustration with the lack of instructions the actual interface provided at that current point in time. Similarly to the first interface, users evaluated the first iteration as being easier to understand due to the tasks. However, when examining the testing survey results there was an improvement for navigating the mobile device also. </p>

                <p>Through these tests, I became more confident with conducting user tests due to the number of tests we had to accomplish in a short time frame. As my biggest weakness as a designer is the lack of confidence to speak to people when conducting research, it was a very important for me to experience not being worried when talking to people I was not well acquainted with. Another thing I learnt to understood was the fact that not all symbols are universal. Despite having changed certain icons multiple times, users still failed to understand what they were supposed to mean. </p>

                <p>The smartwatch interface was chosen as the main device as majority of users preferred the smartwatch over the mobile application in the post experience survey; even with their lack of experience. Some users stated that they felt as though smartwatches were more 'believable' due to many health applications being created for wearables. Other users stated that if they were in severe pain that it was unlikely they would be able to operate a device to triage themselves, whilst the watch knows from constantly assessing the user's vitals.</p>

                <p> The convenience that the watch presented was preferred as it would always be on their body as a wearable. However, as majority of smartwatch applications don't exist as a standalone, a paired equivalent had to be created. With the successful login process that the second iteration of the mobile application presented, it was decided that the final solution would log in using a mobile application. </p>

                <p>Onboarding tutorial screens were created to provide further explanation and documentation on the app's features, with help buttons on the way of the screen. The major changes were that in terms of user testing, the tasks related to triaging for the mobile were deleted, focusing mainly on the profile aspect instead. Seven users in total were tested for the final iteration in preparation of the next assignment. Three of the users chosen are medical professionals (Andrea, Lesha and Stephanie) with only Lesha being her first time to interact with the prototype. Three completely new users were chosen to user test the prototype so that they would evaluate it as a standalone product rather than through its iterative improvements. </p>

                <p>The screens were created on photoshop as images and assembled in InVision to create a high fidelity prototype that users were able to interact with. We addressed as many issues found in the second iteration as possible, adding colours to make the applications functions and buttons more distinct. </p>

                <p>Updated icon designs caused some misunderstandings between users despite majority of the responses being positive. A participant advised to reconsider certain wording and information within the application as its purpose is to be informative. They suggested potentially changing the icons into more detailed drawings but was worried that the detail may make it difficult to distinguish what the image was depicting on the small smart watch screens.   </p>

                <p>This was the most satisfying part of drafting a prototype as a designer, as it was fascinating to see an interface I had created with come to life through colours and interactivity. Despite being fatigued from the amount of paper prototyping required for the user-testing session, I now understand its necessity. Creating high-fidelity mock ups consume too much time when no clear idea has been set and usually takes much longer to fix an error. Even with creating paper prototypes we first created a basic sketch of the interface that had a cohesive flow on a separate piece of paper, using the sketch as reference. </p>

                <h5>First Iteration</h5>
                <p>The first design was user tested using the prototypes made for the final iteration, reaching out to a total of seven different users. The users were three tutors (Ashlynn, Jackson & Sophie), two regular users (Pansy & Eugene) and two medical professionals (Stephanie [medical scribe] & Lesha [nurse]). Through testing this design in the invision format, users were able to get a more realistic interaction of how the prototype would actually work.</p>

                <p>I tested the users Stephanie and Lesha, sending both participants an InVision link to the interfaces. Due to their busy schedule I was unable to test them in person and used the method of calling online instead to write down their feedback. Whilst on call, I also requested for them to share their screen so that I would able to observe their interactions with the prototype despite not being there in person. </p>

                <p>Despite there only being two users who had never interacted with the prototype previously, there were many suggestions and recommendations from all users on how to better the interface. It was interesting as many of the participants we tested previously with paper prototypes were uncertain of what suggestions to make. However, in its interactive form in InVision, users were concise about which changes and features they wanted to see. Although I cannot correlate this directly to the addition of colours and interactivity, I believe that as our interface became more believable users subconsciously asked for features they had wished certain applications would include.</p>

                <p>With a solid user flow, the applications heuristic issues were specifically addressed to improve the overall experience. Some examples of suggestions are; additional help and documentation, cancelled call histories and retrieving personal information such as passwords. An interesting suggestion was the addition of a button to allow users to manually triage themselves using the smartwatch; something that our group had considered with the first iteration of the mobile application. Another suggestion was the ability to check for general practitioners near the user in the watch interface in case of circumstances where users did not wish to go to the hospital.  </p>

              <div class="col-md-12">
                <h5>Second Iteration</h5>
                <p>New screens for additional features on the protoype were created using photoshop, using assets from the previous iteration to ensure consistency. A total of four users were tested, with two new users (Eugene & Wendy) and two medical professionals (Stephanie [medical scribe] & Evan [EMT]). The two users I tested were Evan and Stephanie, with whom I shared links of the prototypes and tested in a similar fashion as the first iteration. In this version one of the major changes were the ability to add an emergency contact, along with the option for the application to alert the contact if the user were to call an ambulance. </p>

                <p>Further customisation was requested on the application such as the inclusion of a profile picture and more information about the user. Stephanie [medical scribe] highlighted the importance of a picture as if a user were to use this application, EMTs having a visual reference for their patience's identity would convenient. Evan [EMT] commented on the importance of consistency and standards in the platform as certain phrases needed to be altered as well as using a universal layout of dates. Both medical professionals also highly advised making the application more accessible. All changes adopted were recieved well by the users, most importantly the new changes did not hinder the existing functions of the prototype or interrupt the userflow. </p>

                <p>By creating these prototypes for the purpose of testing, I learnt once again how important heuristics in design were to consider. In InVision, back buttons are not automatically generated with all buttons having to be manually added and linked to be effective. When the prototypes are tested and an exit is not linked, it forces the user to be stuck on one screen, rendering the application effectively useless if this were to be an actually published. </p>

                <h5>Final Iteration</h5>
                <p>To create the final iteration, all user feedback was carefully considered as this was the last stage of our project. To ensure that nothing was overlooked, we reflected on suggestions made in previous iterations. Similarly to how the previous two iterations were created, the pages of the final iteration were created using photoshop. Due to the necessity of the layout being uniform, I learnt additional aspects of the program I would not have accessed previously. Tools such as rulers and grids were extremely helpful in setting up icons to align correctly.</p>

                <p>A profile picture option was added to the interface, as well as updating phrasing of certain terms to be consistent with what the medical field used. As a group we tried to accomodate an option of a 'colour-blind mode' in the user settings of the watch application for accessibility issues. However due to the nature of InVision, we were not able to replicate such an experience. We also ran into this issue when it came to the biometric security feature we added to our interface. As this was just a prototype, we decided that ultimately it was better to show that we had considered accessibility issues, even if they were unavailable to be experienced through InVision.  </p>

                <p>The final iteration was tested with three users, with only one previous tested user (Stephanie). New users had no issues with the actual interface of the device but could not completely understand the concept of an autonomous system as they had not encountered this type of technology previously. All three users greatly enjoyed the addition of a profile picture, as they had not expected it to be possible through InVision at this point in time. </p>

                <p>Another accessibility issue we considered was creating an option to make the text larger for people who may be visually impaired. However, upon research we discovered that smartwatches already had this as an option in their settings; affecting all applications. An interesting suggestion was to further iterate the function to look for GPs near the user, potentially adding a way to add the user's regular GP to a list to easily contact them. Oxygen saturation being added to the vital section in the smartwatch was another suggestion made as many fitness watches already having pulse oximetry functions, with low O2 sat levels potentially improving the triaging capabilities of the application.</p>

                <p>As a design student, this is the first application interface project that I completed. During this subject, I learnt of the enormous amount of research it takes to even pitch a project before drafting any interfaces. Previous to this, whenever I thought of UI/UX I had always considered that the most difficult aspect would be creating an aesthetically pleasing application. However, as important as aesthetics are, they are useless if the application itself is not useful and does not meet user needs. Only through thorough research can this user need be found and targeted, as before this stage any designs that are considered can be rendered completely useless due to a lack of need.  </p>

                <p>I have also learnt the importance of user feedback through the numerous iterations the prototype has gone through. Users provide a new perspective and are who the UI/UX are ultimately designed for, if the user cannot use the interface, it holds no value. Simple features such as profile pictures or a favourites section make a big difference to the users who interact with the application, giving a better impression to other potential competitors. Through this project, I now understand why each design thinking step is important and is an industry standard when creating applications. In the future I hope to use the knowledge I gained from creating this project with my group members by applying it in other design related fields. </p>
